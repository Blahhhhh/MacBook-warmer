# About

```

## When to use

Suppose you were like me, coming home in a cold winter night, lying into the couch, taking MacBook from backpack, placing it top of laps and ready to do some coding job. However, the ice-cold MacBook stopped you from thinking. Of course you can open an 3D game or a flash page to warm it up, but why not just `warm` and burn your CPU right away? Nothing could be more comfortable than a heater at this time!

## Don't forget

`warm enough` when it's warm enoughÔºÅ
